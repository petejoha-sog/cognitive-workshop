# Lab: Object detection

In this lab you'll build an object detection model using the C# SDK.
A note about the resources used in this lab. To use Custom Vision capabilities you can either use the Custom Vision resource in Azure or you can use the Cognitive Services resource. The Cognitive Services resource works as a wrapper for multiple cognitive services. With that, the training key and the prediction key will be identical.


1. Open the solution in [ObjectDetectionStarter](/ObjectDetectionStarter)
2. Inspect the Program.cs file. Notice that there are a lot of comments but not a lot of code.
3. Follow the guide on Microsoft to fill in the code thats missing and run the application. 
4. Inspect your project in the [Custom Vision portal](https://customvision.ai)
