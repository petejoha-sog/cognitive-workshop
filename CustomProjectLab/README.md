# Lab: Custom project

If you have extra time over, create your own project of something that interests you. 

Some ideas:
- Create a logic app that runs sentiment analysis on tweets posted for a hashtag. Perhaps persit your findings to some store like Cosmos DB.
- Create a chat bot that that can search your own uploaded files as well as a bing search. For inspiration you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/Azure/LearnAI-Bootcamp/blob/master/lab02.3-bing_search/0_README.md). Note that the versions used for packages and services can be a bit out of date.
- Create a Faq with your notes during the workshop.


## Alternative
Another productive way to get familiar with Azure's cognetive services offerings is to take a trip through the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/) for a service that your interested in. Other ways are watching a course on Pluralsight or Youtube.
